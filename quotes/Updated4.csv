CoreLogic is predicting home prices will rise another 5% nationally between May 2022 and May 2023, according to a July report. That's national. Regionally, it'll vary — a lot. There are 98 regional markets out of 392 nationwide with a 50% chance of a home price decline in the next year!

0,https://www.instagram.com/p/CeM0PsuDqei/,"The real estate market in Washington is changing at an extremely rapid pace.🏃 How can we make predictions with so much change? Let's just say it's not easy! Nevertheless, we tried to highlight some trends in the DMV real estate market.

What’s the outlook for considering our extremely low Inventory of available homes for sale?
Let’s just say, not great. Still, there’s reason for buyers to feel hopeful. Inventory often gets better in the Spring. Timing along with higher interest rates could lessen demand for the few homes which are available.

Will Rising Interest Rates Cool Our Market?
Yes, say economists. In an already pricey market like the DMV, more expensive borrowing will almost certainly slow the rapid home-price growth of the last couple years.

What Will Happen to Apartment Rents Now That Things Are Getting More Normal-Ish?
During the depths of the pandemic, rents in the DC area did something they hadn’t done in years: plummet. Unfortunately for today’s apartment-hunters, those days are gone. Apartments in the District, harder-hit than suburban rentals, experienced an incredible rebound in the fourth quarter of 2021, with rents increasing by 19.1 percent.

What’s the outlook for considering our extremely low Inventory of available homes for sale?
Let’s just say, not great. Still, there’s reason for buyers to feel hopeful. Inventory often gets better in the Spring. Timing along with higher interest rates could lessen demand for the few homes which are available.

Will Rising Interest Rates Cool Our Market?
Yes, say economists. In an already pricey market like the DMV, more expensive borrowing will almost certainly slow the rapid home-price growth of the last couple years.

What Will Happen to Apartment Rents Now That Things Are Getting More Normal-Ish?
During the depths of the pandemic, rents in the DC area did something they hadn’t done in years: plummet. Unfortunately for today’s apartment-hunters, those days are gone. Apartments in the District, harder-hit than suburban rentals, experienced an incredible rebound in the fourth quarter of 2021, with rents increasing by 19.1 percent.
