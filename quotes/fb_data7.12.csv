9,Yadira Ayala,"Hi! My friend Zoe and I are moving to New York in May and are looking for 1-2 other roommates! Pretty flexible with our budget but trying to stay in the $1700 range. We’ll be in New York in April checking out apartments / exploring different neighborhoods, but right now we’re still pretty open to different parts of the city.
